    <string name="about_me_textview_text">A former Emergency Medical Technician with a Bachelor degree in Psychology. I began transitioning into software development last year and got accepted into \'NYC Tech Talent Bridge-To-Tech\' program. My interest in tech came about while enrolled in the program.Upon completion, I applied to ‘Pursuit\'. ‘Pursuit\' is a program that prepares individuals who are transition into software development with little or no prior background and they help prepare students with the skills and training required to obtain employment in the field. I never thought coding would be of interest to me. Knowing and seeing that I can create applications that can be helpful and used by others, while solving a problem is very important and interesting to me. That lead to me to building this App. A Meal-Prep app that allow users to input ingredients they have and be provided a list of meal options in which they can prepare. To all the foodies like myself, who enjoy cooking but never knowing what to cook, well, you’re welcome! Continuing to gain hands on experience with Java, Android SDK, Git/GitHub, APIs, Data Structures, Algorithms and the overall culture of tech, in the future I plan to take the skills I have learned and still learning and continue building applications that are beneficial and helpful to others.</string>
